# 🌾 Predict Crop Yield Category

This machine learning project predicts the **crop yield category** based on features such as soil quality, rainfall, and seed type using a Random Forest Classifier. This classification can help in better agricultural planning and resource management.

## 📌 Problem Statement

To build a classification model that can predict the yield category of a crop using environmental and seed-related data.
